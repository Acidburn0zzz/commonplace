# Commonplace

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/commonplace.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/commonplace)

Necessary Node modules for Marketplace frontend projects. Commonplace includes:

- Common Bower and require.js configuration
- Nunjucks template compilation optimizer
- Localization extraction and language pack generation

## Creating a New Marketplace Frontend Project

Clone the [Marketplace template](https://github.com/mozilla/marketplace-template).

Run ```make init```. This will download dependencies and set things up.

## I have questions! Where do I look for more information?

You can check out the
[Wiki](https://github.com/mozilla/commonplace/wiki/_pages), which has plenty of
documentation about the project and the Commonplace framework.
